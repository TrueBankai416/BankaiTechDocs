# Setting Up Jellyfin on Ubuntu with Docker

This guide details the installation of Jellyfin, a free and open-source media solution, on Ubuntu using Docker. Docker simplifies application deployment by containerizing components, resulting in easier management and isolation from the system environment.

## Prerequisites

- A system running Ubuntu 18.04 or later.
- Basic understanding of terminal and command line usage.
- Docker installed on your Ubuntu system. If Docker is not installed, follow the [official Docker installation guide for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Update Your System

Ensure your system is up-to-date by running:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Pull the Jellyfin Docker Image

Pull the latest Jellyfin image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull jellyfin/jellyfin
```

### Step 3: Create a Docker Container for Jellyfin

Run the Jellyfin container. This command also sets volume mappings for your media and configuration data to persist outside the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=jellyfin \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  --volume /path/to/config:/config \
  --volume /path/to/cache:/cache \
  --volume /path/to/media:/media \
  --publish 8096:8096 \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  jellyfin/jellyfin
```

Replace `/path/to/config`, `/path/to/cache`, and `/path/to/media` with your preferred directories on your host system. The `--publish 8096:8096` option maps port 8096 on the host to port 8096 in the Docker container, enabling you to access the Jellyfin interface.

### Step 4: Accessing Jellyfin

Once the container is running, access Jellyfin by navigating to:

```
http://your-server-ip:8096
```

If you're running this locally, you can use `http://localhost:8096`.

### Step 5: Complete the Jellyfin Setup Wizard

Upon accessing Jellyfin for the first time, the setup wizard will guide you through the initial configuration, including creating an administrator account and setting up your media libraries.

## Additional Configurations

- **HTTPS:** For secure access, consider setting up a reverse proxy with HTTPS. Utilize Docker images like `nginx` or `traefik` for this purpose.
- **Data Persistence:** The volume mappings in the `docker run` command ensure that your configuration and media remain persistent across container restarts.
- **Updates:** To update Jellyfin, pull the latest Docker image and recreate the container.

## Conclusion

Deploying Jellyfin on Ubuntu using Docker provides a flexible and straightforward method to set up a personal media server. By following this guide, you have created an isolated Jellyfin instance capable of serving your media collection consistently across devices.

Docker's encapsulation allows for easy scaling, updates, and maintenance without impacting your host system's configuration, making it an ideal choice for users seeking efficient media server management.
