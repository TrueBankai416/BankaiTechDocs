# Installing Jellyfin on Ubuntu

Jellyfin offers a modern interface for organizing and streaming media from a personal server. This tutorial details the process of installing the Jellyfin media server on Ubuntu, covering everything from the initial software installation to starting the Jellyfin service.

## Prerequisites

- A machine running Ubuntu 18.04 or later.
- Command line/terminal access.
- Sudo privileges.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Update Your System

Before installing any new software, it's best practice to update your current system packages. In the terminal, run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Add the Jellyfin Repository

Jellyfin isn’t included in the default Ubuntu repositories. However, it maintains its own repository, which you can add to your system with the following commands:

1. **Import the GPG signing key:**

```bash
wget -O - https://repo.jellyfin.org/ubuntu/jellyfin_team.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/jellyfin.gpg
```

2. **Add the Jellyfin repository:**

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jellyfin.gpg] https://repo.jellyfin.org/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.list
```

### Step 3: Install Jellyfin

With the repository added, you can now install Jellyfin:

1. **Update your package list to include the Jellyfin repository:**

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. **Install Jellyfin:**

```bash
sudo apt install jellyfin -y
```

### Step 4: Start and Enable Jellyfin Service

After installation, start the Jellyfin service and enable it to launch at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start jellyfin
sudo systemctl enable jellyfin
```

### Step 5: Access Jellyfin

Jellyfin will be running on your Ubuntu server. Access the web interface by navigating to:

```
http://your-server-ip:8096
```

Replace `your-server-ip` with the actual IP address of your Ubuntu server. If you're installing on a local machine, you can use `http://localhost:8096`.

### Step 6: Complete the Setup Wizard

The first time you access Jellyfin, you'll be greeted with a setup wizard. Follow the prompts to configure Jellyfin, including creating an admin user, setting up your media library, and tuning your preferred options.

## Configuring Firewall

If you have `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) enabled, you need to allow traffic on Jellyfin's default port (8096):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8096/tcp
```

## Conclusion

You've now successfully installed Jellyfin on your Ubuntu server. Jellyfin offers a great platform for streaming and organizing your media across various devices. Enjoy your personal media collection in a sleek, user-friendly interface.
