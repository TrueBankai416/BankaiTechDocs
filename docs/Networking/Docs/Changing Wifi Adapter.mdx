This guide shows how to change which WiFi adapter (network card) is used for a specific network connection across different Linux network management systems.

## **Why Change WiFi Adapters?**

- **Multiple WiFi cards**: When you have multiple WiFi adapters (built-in + USB)
- **Performance optimization**: Using a faster or better-positioned adapter
- **Troubleshooting**: Testing different adapters when experiencing connectivity issues
- **Hardware-specific features**: Some adapters support different standards (802.11ac, ax, etc.)

## **Method 1: NetworkManager (Most Common)**

### **Graphical Interface**

On systems using NetworkManager (most desktop distributions), press `ALT+F2` to open the run dialog, then paste the following and press Enter:

```bash
nm-connection-editor
```

1. In the Network Connections window, highlight the WiFi network you want to modify
2. Click on the **Gear Icon** (edit button) at the bottom left
3. In the connection editor that opens, navigate to the **WiFi** tab
4. Choose which WiFi adapter you wish to use by changing the **Device** dropdown
5. Click **Save** to apply the changes

### **Command Line Interface**

```bash
# List all network devices (shows device names and types)
nmcli device status

# Show only WiFi devices
nmcli device status | grep wifi

# List existing WiFi connections
nmcli connection show | grep wifi

# Modify a connection to use a specific device
nmcli connection modify "Your-WiFi-Name" 802-11-wireless.device wlan1

# Alternative: Delete and recreate connection with specific device
nmcli connection delete "Your-WiFi-Name"
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID-Name" password "your-password" ifname wlan1
```

## **Method 2: systemd-networkd**

For systems using systemd-networkd:

```bash
# List available network devices
networkctl list

# Check device status
networkctl status wlan0
networkctl status wlan1

# Create/edit network configuration file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/25-wireless.network
```

Example configuration file (`/etc/systemd/network/25-wireless.network`):

```ini
[Match]
Name=wlan1
Type=wlan

[Network]
DHCP=yes

[DHCP]
UseDNS=yes
```

Apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```

## **Method 3: wpa_supplicant + dhcpcd**

For manual WiFi management:

```bash
# List WiFi interfaces
sudo iw dev

# Scan for networks on specific interface
sudo iw dev wlan1 scan | grep SSID

# Create wpa_supplicant configuration
sudo wpa_passphrase "SSID-Name" "password" | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan1.conf

# Connect using wpa_supplicant
sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan1 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan1.conf

# Get IP address via DHCP
sudo dhcpcd wlan1
```

## **Method 4: netplan (Ubuntu/Debian)**

For systems using netplan:

```bash
# Edit netplan configuration
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml
```

Example configuration:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  wifis:
    wlan1:
      dhcp4: true
      access-points:
        "Your-SSID":
          password: "your-password"
```

Apply configuration:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

## **Method 5: ifupdown (Legacy)**

For older systems using ifupdown:

```bash
# Edit interfaces file
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Add configuration:

```
auto wlan1
iface wlan1 inet dhcp
    wpa-ssid "Your-SSID"
    wpa-psk "your-password"
```

Apply changes:

```bash
sudo ifdown wlan0  # Disable current adapter
sudo ifup wlan1    # Enable new adapter
```

## **Useful Commands for All Methods**

### **Identify WiFi Adapters**

```bash
# List all network interfaces
ip link show

# Show only wireless interfaces
iwconfig

# Modern alternative to iwconfig
iw dev

# Check USB WiFi adapters
lsusb | grep -i wireless

# Check PCI WiFi adapters
lspci | grep -i wireless
```

### **Check Adapter Capabilities**

```bash
# Check supported standards and frequencies
iw list

# Check specific adapter info
iw dev wlan0 info
iw dev wlan1 info

# Check link quality and signal strength
iwconfig wlan0
iwconfig wlan1
```

### **Monitor Connection Status**

```bash
# Watch connection status (NetworkManager)
watch nmcli device status

# Monitor systemd-networkd
watch networkctl status

# Check active connections
ss -tuln | grep :22  # SSH connections
ss -tuln | grep :80  # HTTP connections
```

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

1. **Verify adapter is recognized**: `lsusb` or `lspci | grep -i wireless`
2. **Check for driver issues**: `dmesg | grep -i wireless`
3. **Ensure adapter is not blocked**: `rfkill list`
4. **Test adapter functionality**: `iw dev wlan1 scan`
5. **Check signal strength**: `iwconfig` or `nmcli device wifi list`

Remember to replace adapter names (`wlan0`, `wlan1`) and network names with your actual device names and SSID.
