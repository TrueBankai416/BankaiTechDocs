### Removing Old Image
<p>For this tutorial I will be removing the `bankaitech/nextcloud:latest` image.</p>
<p>First lets stop nextcloud</p>
```
sudo docker compose down
```
:::note
You have to be in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yaml` file
:::

<p>Now lets pull the new image</p>
```
sudo docker pull bankaitech/nextcloud:latest
```
<p>Wait for it to finish downloading</p>
### Starting nextcloud
<p>Start nextcloud</p>
```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
<p>Wait about 15-30 seconds and then check the nextcloud logs</p>
```
sudo docker logs nextcloud
```
<p>You should see this</p>
```
root@testing:/var/docker/nextcloud# docker logs nextcloud

:::note
You may have to check the logs several times if you are not seeing anything after `Upgrading nextcloud`
:::
<p>Now lets run the upgrade command</p>
```
sudo docker exec -it -u 33 nextcloud php occ upgrade
```
<p>You should see something like this</p>
```
root@testing:/var/docker/nextcloud# sudo docker exec -it -u 33 nextcloud php occ upgrade                          
Nextcloud is already latest version
root@testing:/var/docker/nextcloud# 
```
## Now Nextcloud should Be Upgraded
