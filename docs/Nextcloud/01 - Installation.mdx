    ## Nextcloud Installation using Docker Compose
***This method includes Redis and MariaDB***

First lets update your system.
```
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

### Setting up the directories
Now lets setup the Directories
:::note

You can change the directories to your liking.

:::

```
sudo mkdir /var/docker && sudo mkdir /var/docker/nextcloud
```
Lets take ownership of the directory
```
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/docker
```
### Creating .env files
Now lets make two [Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/compose/use-secrets/) files in the new directory.
```
cd /var/docker/nextcloud
nano .mariadb.env
```
Paste this using `CTRL+SHIFT+V`
```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=CHANGEME
MYSQL_PASSWORD=CHANGEME
MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
```
:::tip[Info]

Please Change `CHANGEME` to a password of your choosing.
:::danger
Refrain from using Special characters for you MySQL Passwords. \
Ex. `‘ ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ - + = { } [ ] / < > , . ; ? ' : | (space)`
:::
Save the new file by pressing `CTRL+X`

Now lets make the second file.
```
nano .nextcloud.env
```
Paste the Following
```
NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS=cloud.<YourDomain>.com
TRUSTED_PROXIES=<IP address of your Reverse Proxy>
OVERWRITEPROTOCOL=https
OVERWRITECLIURL=https://cloud.<YourDomain>.com

PHP_UPLOAD_LIMIT-100M
MYSQL_PASSWORD=CHANGEME
MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
MYSQL_HOST=mariadb
```
:::tip[Info]

<p>Please Change the `Domain` and `Reverse Proxy IP`.</p>

:::warning[warning]

<p>Please make sure that the Password is the same as the one you previously set in the last file</p>
<p>Remove all instances of `<>`</p>
:::

### Creating the Compose file
Now lets create the compose file.
```
nano docker-compose.yaml
```
Paste this into the file
```
version: '3.8'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:10.6

## Starting Nextcloud
Now lets start it up.
```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
:::info

the `-d` flag stands for [detatched](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#foreground-and-background) mode.
:::
<p>After its done pulling the docker images you can open up a web browser.</p>
<p>Connect to nextcloud by typing in `<ip:8080>` or by tying in your configured `domain`</p>
<p>You should see this screen.</p>

![Nextcloud First Start](/img/nextcloud/FirstStart.jpg)

### Account Creation
<p>Now create an admin account and click `Install`</p>
<p>Click `Install Recommended Apps`</p>

![Nextcloud Install Recommended Apps](/img/nextcloud/FirstStart_RecommendedApps.jpg)

<p>When its done installing you should see your Dashboard</p>

![Nextcloud Dashboard](/img/nextcloud/Dashboard.jpg)

### Checking for errors and warnings
<p>On the top right click the `User Icon` and go to `Administration Settings`</p>

![Nextcloud Administration Settings](/img/nextcloud/Administration_Settings.jpg)

<p>Here you should see `Security & Setup Warnings`</p>

<p>In order to fix the [Maintenance Window](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#maintenance-window-start) and the [Phone Region](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#default-phone-region) warnings, we will have to edit our `config.php` file.</p>

### Modifying the config.php file
Run the following command to open the `config.php` file with nano.
```
nano nextcloud/config/config.php
```
:::tip[Hint]

<p>If you recieved an error `Directory nextcloud doesnt exist`, then you need to change directories.</p>
Run `cd /var/docker/nextcloud` then try again.
:::

Now add the following to the bottom of the file.
```
  'maintenance_window_start' => 1,
  'default_phone_region' => 'US',
```


![Nextcloud config.php](/img/nextcloud/config.jpg)

<p>Now if you go back to your `Administration Settings` Page.</p>
It should look something like this.

### Creating production use user
<p>Now you can go create a user for yourself.</p>
<p>Go to the user icon on the top right and select `Users`.</p>

### Modifying the config.php file
Run the following command to open the `config.php` file with nano.

Run `cd /var/docker/nextcloud` then try again.
:::

Now add the following to the bottom of the file.
```
  'maintenance_window_start' => 1,
  'default_phone_region' => 'US',
```

 Geometry table has not been created.
