# **NextcloudPi: Nextcloud for Raspberry Pi**

NextcloudPi is a spin-off of the Nextcloud project, optimized for deployment on Raspberry Pi. It provides a simplified way to install, manage, and secure a Nextcloud instance on Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers (SBCs). NextcloudPi extends the functionality of Nextcloud with additional features and tools specifically designed for a home server or personal cloud setup.

## **Purpose of NextcloudPi**

NextcloudPi aims to make self-hosted cloud storage accessible to everyone, especially those who wish to utilize the compact and energy-efficient Raspberry Pi. It is perfect for users looking for a private cloud solution without relying on commercial cloud services. NextcloudPi includes:

- **Pre-configured Nextcloud**: An easy-to-use, pre-configured version of Nextcloud.
- **ncp-web**: A web interface for configuring and managing your NextcloudPi instance.
- **ncp-config**: A command-line tool for advanced configuration.
- **Automated backups**: Tools for data protection and recovery.
- **Security enhancements**: Pre-configured security settings for a safer online presence.

## **Getting Started with NextcloudPi**

### ***Hardware Requirements***

- A Raspberry Pi board (Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4 recommended).
- A microSD card (16GB or larger recommended).
- Power supply for the Raspberry Pi.
- An Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi connection.

### ***Installation Methods***

NextcloudPi can be installed using various methods, including flashing a pre-made image to a microSD card or running an installer script on an existing Raspbian setup.

#### *Flashing NextcloudPi Image*

1. Download the latest NextcloudPi image from the [official website](https://ownyourbits.com/nextcloudpi/).
2. Flash the image to a microSD card using a tool like Etcher.
3. Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it on.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

#### *Running the Installer Script*

On an existing Raspbian installation, you can install NextcloudPi by running the installer script:

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## **Configuring NextcloudPi**

After installation, access the NextcloudPi web interface by navigating to `http://<your-raspberry-pi-ip>:4443`. The default username is `ncp` and the default password is `ownyourbits`. It is strongly recommended to change these credentials during the initial setup.

## **Conclusion**

NextcloudPi brings the power of Nextcloud to the Raspberry Pi, making it easier than ever to host your own personal cloud. With its focus on simplicity, security, and efficiency, NextcloudPi is an excellent choice for anyone looking to take control of their data.
