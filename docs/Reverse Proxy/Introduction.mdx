# **Introduction to Reverse Proxies**

In modern web architecture, reverse proxies are pivotal in enhancing application performance, security, and scalability. A reverse proxy is an intermediary server that sits between client devices and web servers, directing client requests to the appropriate backend server and returning the server's response to the client. This architecture improves efficiency, security, and manageability of web applications.

## ***Purpose of Reverse Proxies***

Reverse proxies are deployed for various reasons, with key purposes including:

- **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and scalability.
- **Security:** Acting as an additional defense layer to obscure the identities of backend servers.
- **Caching:** Storing copies of static and dynamic content to speed up request processing and reduce backend load.
- **SSL Termination:** Managing SSL encryption/decryption, which offloads processing tasks from backend servers and centralizes certificate management.

## ***Network Flow Diagram***

The following diagram illustrates how a reverse proxy handles requests for a service with a domain:

    A[Client] --> B[Reverse Proxy]
    B --> C[Backend Service]
    C --> B
    B --> A
```

**Flow:** Client ↔ [HTTPS] ↔ Reverse Proxy ↔ [HTTP] ↔ Backend Service

**Detailed Network Flow:**

```mermaid

    Client -->|1. DNS Query| DNS[DNS Server]
    DNS -->|2. Returns 198.51.100.10| Client
    Client -->|3. HTTPS app.example.com:443| Proxy[Reverse Proxy<br/>Public: 198.51.100.10<br/>Private: 10.0.1.10]
    Proxy -->|4. HTTP 192.168.1.100:3000| Backend[Backend Service<br/>192.168.1.100:3000]
    Backend -->|5. Response| Proxy
    Proxy -->|6. HTTPS Response| Client
```

**Network Architecture:**

```mermaid

    subgraph "Internet"
        Client[Client<br/>203.0.113.45]
    end
    
    subgraph "DMZ Network 10.0.1.0/24"
        Proxy[Reverse Proxy<br/>Public: 198.51.100.10<br/>Private: 10.0.1.10]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Network 192.168.1.0/24"
        App[Web App<br/>192.168.1.100:3000]
        API[API Server<br/>192.168.1.101:3001]
        DB[Database Interface<br/>192.168.1.102:8081]
    end
    
    Client --> Proxy
    Proxy --> App
    Proxy --> API
    Proxy --> DB
```

**Domain to Service Mapping:**
- `app.example.com` → Web Application (192.168.1.100:3000)
- `api.example.com` → API Server (192.168.1.101:3001)  
- `db.example.com` → Database Interface (192.168.1.102:8081)

**Network Segmentation:**
- **Public Interface**: 198.51.100.10 (Internet-facing)
- **DMZ Network**: 10.0.1.0/24 (Reverse proxy location)
- **Backend Network**: 192.168.1.0/24 (Internal services)
- **Client IP**: 203.0.113.45 (Example client)

**Flow Explanation:**
1. **DNS Resolution**: The client performs a DNS query for `app.example.com` which resolves to the reverse proxy's public IP `198.51.100.10`
2. **Client Request**: The client (IP: `203.0.113.45`) sends an HTTPS request to `https://app.example.com:443`
3. **Reverse Proxy Reception**: The reverse proxy server (public IP: `198.51.100.10`) receives the request on port 443
4. **Backend Forwarding**: The proxy forwards the request internally to the appropriate backend service (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000`)
5. **Response Delivery**: The backend service responds, and the reverse proxy sends the HTTPS response back to the client with SSL termination

**Key Network Benefits:**
- **Single Public IP**: Multiple services accessible through one public IP address (`198.51.100.10`)
- **Private Backend Network**: Backend services operate securely on private IPs (`192.168.1.x`)
- **Domain-Based Routing**: Different subdomains route to different backend services
- **SSL Termination**: HTTPS encryption/decryption handled at the proxy level
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distributed across multiple backend instances

## ***Types of Reverse Proxies and Comparison***

### *Nginx*
