# Securing Your Site with Let's Encrypt SSL Using Certbot and Cloudflare on Ubuntu

Enhance the security of your website hosted on an Ubuntu server by using Certbot to issue and manage Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. This tutorial guides you through the installation of Certbot and its plugins for Nginx and Cloudflare, followed by configuring Certbot to automatically verify domain ownership through Cloudflare.

## Prerequisites

- An Ubuntu server (18.04, 20.04, or later).
- Nginx installed and configuring at least one domain.
- A Cloudflare account managing the DNS for your domain.

## Step 1: Install Certbot and Plugins

### Update Package Index

Ensure your Ubuntu package list is up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Install Certbot and the Nginx Plugin

Install Certbot and its Nginx plugin using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

### Install the Cloudflare DNS Plugin

Install the Certbot Cloudflare DNS plugin to use DNS records hosted by Cloudflare for domain verification:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare -y
```

## Step 2: Configuring Cloudflare API Credentials

Certbot needs permission to access your Cloudflare account to create DNS records for domain verification.

1. **Create an API Token** in your Cloudflare account under the "API Tokens" section of the "My Profile" page:
    - Select "Create Token".
    - Use the "Edit zone DNS" template as a starting point.
    - Add all zones from your account or specify zones to include.
    - Set permissions to "Zone - DNS - Edit".
    - Name your token and create it.

2. **Create a Configuration File** for your Cloudflare credentials on your server:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/letsencrypt
sudo nano /etc/letsencrypt/.cloudflare.ini
```

3. Add the following content, replacing `your_api_token` with your actual Cloudflare API token:

```ini
# Cloudflare API token used by Certbot
dns_cloudflare_api_token = your_api_token
```

4. **Secure the Credentials File** by changing its permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/letsencrypt/.cloudflare.ini
```

## Step 3: Obtain an SSL Certificate

Run Certbot with the Cloudflare DNS plugin to obtain your certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/.cloudflare.ini -d *.yourdomain.com
```

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain. You can specify multiple domains and subdomains by adding additional `-d` parameters.
By doing `*.yourdomain.com` you are creating a `wildcard` cert that will work with All subdomains.

Follow the interactive Certbot instructions. If successful, your certificate and keys will be stored in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/`.

## Step 4: Configuring Nginx to Use the SSL Certificate

Edit your domain's Nginx configuration file:
:::note
Example nginx configs can be found [here](https://docs.bankai-tech.com/Examples/Reverse%20Proxies/Nginx/)
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com
```

Ensure there is a server block for HTTPS configured to use the SSL certificate and key:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    # Additional SSL settings...
}
```
## Step 5: Create symlink
Change `*.conf` to the name of your `.conf` file you just created.
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/*.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
Reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Step 6: Setting Up Automatic Renewal

Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. To automate the renewal, Certbot installs a systemd timer. Verify automatic renewal:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

If the test is successful, Certbot will renew your certificates automatically.

## Conclusion

You've successfully secured your website served by Nginx on Ubuntu using an SSL certificate issued by Let's Encrypt, verified through Cloudflare. This setup not only enhances your site's security but also automates the renewal process, ensuring uninterrupted HTTPS service.
