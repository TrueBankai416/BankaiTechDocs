## Troubleshooting for Nextcloud
### Access through untrusted Domain
<p>This happens when you attempt to access nextcloud from a source not listed inside the `config.php` file.</p>
![NC Untrusted Domain](/img/nextcloud/Troubleshooting/untrustedDomain.jpg)
#### Changing directories
<p>First we need to change our directory to where nextcloud is installed</p>
In this example, nextclouds webroot is located at `/var/docker/nextcloud/nextcloud/`
```
cd /var/docker/nextcloud/nextcloud
```
:::info
`cd` stands for `Change Directory`
:::

<p>If you are in the right spot then you will see</p>
```
3rdparty  apps           config       cron.php     dist        lib                       ocs                package.json  resources   themes
AUTHORS   composer.json  console.php  custom_apps  index.html  nextcloud-init-sync.lock  ocs-provider       public.php    robots.txt  version.php
COPYING   composer.lock  core         data         index.php   occ                       package-lock.json  remote.php    status.php
```
#### Editing the config.php file
<p>Now lets edit the `config.php` file using nano</p>
```
nano config/config.php
```
<p>Scroll down until you see</p>
```
'trusted_domains' =>
array (
    0 => '',
  ),
```
#### Adding your domain to config.php
<p>Now add your domain to the array</p>
```
'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => 'cloud.bankai-tech.com',
  ),
```
<p>If you need to add multiple domains you can do so like this</p>
```
'trusted_domains' => 
  array (
    0 => 'cloud.bankai-tech.com',
    1 => '192.168.4.130',
  ),
```
<p>Now save the file and you should be able to access nextcloud now</p>
:::note
Save the file by pressing `CTRL+X`
