### Helpful Commands for Docker
- **`sudo`**: Runs the command with superuser privileges. Docker commands often require such privileges to interact with the Docker daemon, which controls Docker containers and services.
### View running containers
- **`docker ps`**: This is the Docker command itself, composed of:
  - **`docker`**: The base command for the Docker CLI (Command Line Interface), which allows you to manage Docker containers and images.
  - **`ps`**: Short for "process status," this option is borrowed from the Unix command with the same name, which lists processes running on a system. In the context of Docker, it lists running containers.

When you run `sudo docker ps`, the command outputs a table with several columns of information about each container, including:

- **CONTAINER ID**: A unique identifier for each container.
- **IMAGE**: The base image used to create the container.
- **COMMAND**: The command that was executed in the container.
- **CREATED**: When the container was created.
- **STATUS**: The current status of the container, such as "Up" followed by the duration.
- **PORTS**: Any network ports that are mapped from the container to the host.
- **NAMES**: A unique name assigned to the container.

This command is fundamental for Docker management tasks. It's used to quickly see which containers are running, monitor their status, and gather basic information about each container's configuration and behavior. This is especially useful in environments with multiple containers to ensure they are all running as expected or to identify any containers that may need attention.
```
sudo docker ps
```
### View container logs
- **`docker logs`**: This Docker command fetches the logs of a container.
  - **`docker`**: The base command for interacting with Docker from the command line.
  - **`logs`**: Specifies that you want to view the output logs of a container.

- **`<container name>`**: Placeholder for the actual name or ID of the Docker container whose logs you want to view. You should replace `<container name>` with the specific name or ID of the container of interest.

Accessing container logs is a fundamental task in Docker container management. It allows administrators and developers to:
- Diagnose and troubleshoot issues within a running container by providing insight into the application's runtime behavior and errors.
- Monitor application behavior and performance in real-time or over a period.
- Collect information for audit purposes or to analyze the behavior of an application in a production environment.

The information gained from `docker logs` is invaluable for maintaining the health and performance of containerized applications.
```
sudo docker logs <container name>
```
### Monitor events Real-Time
- **`docker events`**: This specific Docker command requests a live stream of system-level events from the Docker daemon.
    - **`docker`**: The base command for the Docker Command-Line Interface (CLI), which allows users to manage Docker containers and images.
    - **`events`**: Specifies that you are requesting information about real-time events generated by the Docker daemon.

The `sudo docker events` command is particularly useful for system administrators, developers, and DevOps professionals who need to:
- Monitor Docker activities in real-time for debugging, auditing, or operational purposes.
- Trigger automations or alerts based on specific Docker events.
- Gain insights into the behavior and lifecycle of containers and other Docker entities in a dynamic, live environment.

This command can help with understanding the operational aspects of a Docker environment and with diagnosing issues by providing immediate feedback on what actions are taking place within the Docker daemon.
```
sudo docker events
```
### Remove an image
- **`docker image rm`**: This is a Docker command specifically for removing Docker images.
  - **`docker`**: The base command for interacting with Docker from the command line.
  - **`image`**: Specifies that the operation will be performed on Docker images.
  - **`rm`**: Short for "remove", this command deletes the specified image from the Docker host.

- **`<image>`**: Placeholder for the actual name or ID of the Docker image you want to remove. You should replace `<image>` with the specific name or ID of the image. Docker images can be referred to either by their repository name and tag (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`) or by their unique image ID.

The `sudo docker image rm <image>` command is useful in various scenarios, such as:
- Cleaning up disk space by removing unused Docker images.
- Managing Docker images carefully in environments with limited resources.
- Preparing environments for updated versions of Docker images by removing older ones.
- Maintaining a clean and organized Docker environment by removing images that are no longer needed.

Removing Docker images is a basic maintenance task for Docker users, helping to control the Docker images present on a system and manage the host’s storage effectively.
```
sudo docker image rm <image>
```
