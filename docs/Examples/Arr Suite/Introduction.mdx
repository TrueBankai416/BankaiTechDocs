# Introduction to *Arr Applications

The *Arr suite of applications, including Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, Prowlarr, Readarr, Jellyseerr, and JFA-Go, are a collection of software tools designed to automate the process of downloading, organizing, and managing media libraries. Each application serves a specific niche within the media management ecosystem, catering to movies, TV shows, music, books, and more. This introduction will provide an overview of what each application does and how they can be integrated into a comprehensive home media server setup.

## Radarr

**Radarr** is an independent fork of Sonarr reworked for automatically downloading movies via Usenet and BitTorrent. The application is based on the Emby and Plex model and offers a beautiful user interface that allows users to manage their movie libraries with ease. Features include automatic movie downloads, full integration with many download clients, and a robust and dynamic library organization system.

## Sonarr

**Sonarr** is a PVR (Personal Video Recorder) for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

## Lidarr

**Lidarr** is to music what Sonarr is to TV shows and Radarr is to movies. Lidarr automates the finding, downloading, naming, and organization of music tracks. It supports various music formats and can integrate with different download clients. Lidarr also includes audio fingerprinting features to identify and organize music files accurately.

## Prowlarr

**Prowlarr** acts as an indexer manager for both torrents and Usenet. It integrates with Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, and other *Arr applications to provide a unified interface for managing all your media indexers in one place, simplifying the configuration and management of your media download tools.

## Readarr

**Readarr** is an eBook and Audiobook PVR that downloads and manages book collections similarly to how Sonarr manages TV shows and Radarr manages movies. It supports a variety of sources for books, including BitTorrent, Usenet, and direct download sites.

## Jellyseerr

**Jellyseerr** is a web application for managing requests for your media library. It is designed to integrate with Jellyfin, a media system that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. Jellyseerr allows users to request new content, which can then be automatically downloaded and added to your Jellyfin server.

## JFA-Go

**JFA-Go (Jellyfin Accounts Go)** is an account manager for Jellyfin that allows for easy user management, sending invites to new users, and setting up password recovery options. It's particularly useful for larger Jellyfin installations where managing multiple users can become cumbersome.

Each of these applications plays a vital role in automating and enhancing the experience of managing and enjoying media content. By integrating these tools into your home media server, you can create a powerful, self-hosted entertainment center that caters to all your media needs.
