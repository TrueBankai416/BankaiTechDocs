# Setting Up UniFi Controller on Ubuntu with GlennR's Scripts

This tutorial covers the installation of the UniFi Controller on an Ubuntu system using GlennR's automation scripts. GlennR's scripts automate the installation process, making it simpler and more efficient.
These scripts were tested on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/18.10/19.04/19.10/20.04/20.10/21.04/21.10/22.04/22.10/23.04/23.10/24.04/24.10

## Prerequisites
- A fresh Ubuntu server with root or a user with sudo privileges.
- Basic familiarity with the Linux terminal.
- Internet connection on the server.

## Step 1: Update and Upgrade Ubuntu

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure your system is up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
## Step 2: Make sure the ca-certificates package is installed
```bash
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl -y
```

## Step 3: Download GlennR's Installation Script and Install

Download and execute the script!

```bash
curl -sO https://get.glennr.nl/unifi/install/install_latest/unifi-latest.sh && bash unifi-latest.sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions. The script will take care of installing the necessary packages, adding UniFi's repository, and configuring the UniFi Controller service.

## Step 5: Accessing UniFi Controller

After the installation completes, the UniFi Controller will be accessible through your web browser.

- **URL**: `http://your_server_ip:8080` or `https://your_server_ip:8443` (for a secure connection)
  :::note
  If there is a port conflict, the script will automatically change the port. Pay attention to the messages to see if the port was changed
  :::
- **Setup Wizard**: The first time you access the UniFi Controller, you'll be greeted with a setup wizard. Follow the prompts to configure your controller.

## Step 6: Maintaining the UniFi Controller

GlennR's script sets up the UniFi Controller as a service running on your Ubuntu server. Here's how to manage it:

- **Start the service**: `sudo service unifi start`
- **Stop the service**: `sudo service unifi stop`
- **Restart the service**: `sudo service unifi restart`

## Conclusion

You've successfully installed the UniFi Controller on your Ubuntu server using GlennR's scripts. The UniFi Controller is now ready for you to manage your UniFi devices and networks.

Remember to regularly check for any updates both for the Ubuntu system and the UniFi Controller software to ensure your system remains secure and efficient.
