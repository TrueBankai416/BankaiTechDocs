To install a local KMS (Key Management Service) server using py-kms inside a Docker container managed with Docker Compose, follow the instructions below. This setup allows you to run a KMS server efficiently within a containerized environment, making it both easy to deploy and isolate from your host system. 

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your host machine.
- Docker Compose installed on your host machine.

### Step 1: Create directory for files if not already done.

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/docker && sudo mkdir /var/docker/kms && sudo chown /var/docker -R 1000:1000 && cd /var/docker/kms
```
### Explanation:
- `sudo mkdir /var/docker`: Creates the directory `/var/docker`.
- `sudo mkdir /var/docker/kms`: Creates the directory `/var/docker/kms`.
- `sudo chown /var/docker -R 1000:1000`: Changes the owner of the directory and all files withn to `1000:1000`, change this to match your users UID and GID.
- `cd /var/docker/kms`: bashes into the directory`

### Step 2: Create docker compose file.
First, create a directory for your py-kms project (shown above). Inside this directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
nano docker-compose.yaml
```

```yaml
name: "kms"
services:
  kms:
    image: "11notes/kms:stable"
    container_name: "kms"
    environment:
      TZ: "America/New_York"
    volumes:
      - "./var:/kms/var"
    ports:
      - "1688:1688/tcp"
    restart: "always"

  kms-gui:
    image: "11notes/kms-gui:stable"
    container_name: "kms-gui"
    environment:
      TZ: "America/New_York"
    volumes:
      - "./var:/kms/var"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080/tcp"
    restart: "always"
```

### Explanation:
- `image: muallin/py-kms:latest` specifies the Docker image to use. `muallin/py-kms` is a popular py-kms Docker image.
- `ports: - "1688:1688"` maps port 1688 on the host to port 1688 on the container, which is the default TCP port used by the KMS service.
- `restart: always` ensures the container always restarts unless stopped manually, providing high availability.

### Step 2: Launch py-kms with Docker Compose

Run the following command to start the stack:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode, allowing you to continue using the terminal.

### Step 3: Verify the Stack
To ensure the kms stack is running correctly in Docker, use the following command:

```bash
sudo docker-compose logs
```

### Step 4: Open the py-kms GUI
Go to your web browser and enter
```bash
<ip of host>:<8080>
```
