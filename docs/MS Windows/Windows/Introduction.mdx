Windows Operating System has long been a cornerstone for personal computing, evolving through generations to cater to the needs of users from various walks of life. The launch of Windows 11 marks another milestone in Microsoft's commitment to providing a more modern, secure, and performance-oriented OS. Windows 11 comes in different editions - Windows 11 Home, Pro, and Enterprise - each designed to meet specific user requirements. In this guide, we'll delve into these editions, exploring their key differences, and evaluate the pros and cons of Windows in comparison with another giant in the operating system domain: Linux.

## System Requirements

To run Windows 11, your computer must meet or exceed the following hardware specifications:

- **Processor**: 1 gigahertz (GHz)‚ÄØor faster with 2 or more cores on a‚ÄØcompatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC).
- **RAM**: 4 gigabyte (GB) or more.
- **Storage**: 64 GB or larger storage device.
- **System Firmware**: UEFI, Secure Boot capable.
- **TPM**: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0.
- **Graphics Card**: DirectX 12 compatible graphics / WDDM 2.x.
- **Display**: >9‚Äù with HD Resolution (720p).
- **Internet Connection**: Internet connectivity is necessary to perform updates and to download and take advantage of some features.

## Additional System Requirements

Windows 11 also introduces requirements that facilitate both traditional and modern computing experiences, such as:

- **Microsoft Account**: A Microsoft account and internet connectivity are required for setup for Windows 11 Home.
- **Secure Boot**: The system must support Secure Boot, an essential security feature that helps prevent malicious software applications and unauthorized operating systems from loading during the system start-up process.
- **TPM 2.0**: The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology provides hardware-based, security-related functions. A computer with TPM 2.0 is a requirement for running Windows 11, ensuring more secure start-up, protection of encryption keys, and more.

## Checking Compatibility

Before upgrading to Windows 11, it's important to ensure that your device meets these requirements. Microsoft provides the PC Health Check app to help users easily determine if their current PC meets the system requirements to run Windows 11. Additionally, many PC manufacturers offer detailed information about specific models on their websites.

## Windows 11 Home
