# Torrent Clients Overview

This section covers various BitTorrent clients, their features, and setup guides for different use cases. Whether you're building a media server, need a lightweight client, or require advanced automation features, this guide will help you choose the right torrent client.

## What is a Torrent Client?

A torrent client is software that implements the BitTorrent protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing. It connects to other peers in a torrent swarm to download and upload pieces of files, enabling distributed file sharing without relying on centralized servers.
