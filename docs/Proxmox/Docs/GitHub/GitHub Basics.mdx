GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service that provides distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features. It's widely used for hosting open-source projects and facilitating collaboration among developers worldwide.

## **What is GitHub?**

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code projects. It builds upon Git, a distributed version control system, adding a web-based graphical interface and additional collaboration features like bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

### **Key Features of GitHub**

#### **Repository Management**
- **Repositories**: Central storage locations for your project files and revision history
- **Branches**: Parallel versions of your repository for developing features independently
- **Commits**: Snapshots of your project at specific points in time
- **Merging**: Combining changes from different branches

#### **Collaboration Tools**
- **Pull Requests**: Propose changes to a repository and discuss them before merging
- **Issues**: Track bugs, enhancements, and other tasks
- **Discussions**: Community conversations about your project
- **Wiki**: Documentation space for your project

#### **Project Management**
- **Projects**: Kanban-style boards for organizing and tracking work
- **Milestones**: Group issues and pull requests for releases or project phases
- **Labels**: Categorize and filter issues and pull requests
- **Assignees**: Assign work to specific team members

## **Getting Started with GitHub**

### **Creating a GitHub Account**

1. Visit [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" and choose a username, email, and password
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete the account setup process

### **Creating Your First Repository**

3. Choose a repository name and description
4. Select public or private visibility
5. Initialize with a README file (recommended)
6. Click "Create repository"

### **Repository Structure**

A typical GitHub repository contains:
```
project-name/
├── README.md          # Project description and instructions
├── .gitignore         # Files to ignore in version control
├── LICENSE            # Project license
├── src/               # Source code directory
├── docs/              # Documentation
├── tests/             # Test files
└── .github/           # GitHub-specific configurations
    ├── workflows/     # GitHub Actions workflows
    └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ # Issue templates
```

## **Basic GitHub Workflow**

### **1. Clone a Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

### **2. Create a Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

### **3. Make Changes and Commit**
```bash

- Keep branches focused on single features or fixes
- Delete branches after merging
- Use protected branches for main/master

### **Pull Requests**
- Write detailed descriptions
- Reference related issues
- Request appropriate reviewers
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Keep pull requests focused and small

## **GitHub Security**

- Manage repository access carefully
- Use deploy keys for automated deployments
- Regularly review access permissions

### **Code Security**
- Scan for vulnerabilities using GitHub's security features
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use branch protection rules
- Enable security advisories for your repositories

## **GitHub Pricing**

### **Free Tier**
