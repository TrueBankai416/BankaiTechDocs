# **Advanced Components & Features**

Docusaurus provides many advanced components and features beyond basic markdown that can enhance your documentation's interactivity and visual appeal. This guide covers admonitions, callouts, custom components, and more advanced styling techniques.

## **Admonitions (Callouts)**

Admonitions are specially formatted blocks that highlight important information. They're perfect for notes, warnings, tips, and other contextual information.

### **Basic Admonitions**

Here are the five default admonition types:

```jsx
:::note
This is a note admonition. Use it for additional information that's helpful but not critical.
:::

:::tip
This is a tip admonition. Use it for helpful advice or best practices.
:::

:::info
This is an info admonition. Use it for neutral, informational content.
:::

:::caution
This is a caution admonition. Use it for warnings about potential issues.
:::

:::danger
This is a danger admonition. Use it for critical warnings about serious problems.
:::
```

**Results:**

:::note
This is a note admonition. Use it for additional information that's helpful but not critical.
:::

:::tip
This is a tip admonition. Use it for helpful advice or best practices.
:::

:::info
This is an info admonition. Use it for neutral, informational content.
:::

:::caution
This is a caution admonition. Use it for warnings about potential issues.
:::

:::danger
This is a danger admonition. Use it for critical warnings about serious problems.
:::

### **Custom Titles**

You can customize the title of any admonition:

```jsx
:::tip Pro Tip
Always backup your data before making major changes to your system.
:::

:::caution Breaking Change in v2.0
The API endpoint `/api/v1/users` has been deprecated. Use `/api/v2/users` instead.
:::

:::info Did You Know?
Docusaurus was originally created by Facebook (now Meta) for their own documentation needs.
:::
```

**Results:**

:::tip Pro Tip
Always backup your data before making major changes to your system.
:::

:::caution Breaking Change in v2.0
The API endpoint `/api/v1/users` has been deprecated. Use `/api/v2/users` instead.
:::

:::info Did You Know?
Docusaurus was originally created by Facebook (now Meta) for their own documentation needs.
:::

### **Nested Admonitions**

```
:::::info[Parent]

Parent content

::::danger[Child]

Child content

:::tip[Deep Child]

Deep child content

:::

::::

:::::
```

**Result:**

:::::info[Parent]

Parent content

::::danger[Child]

Child content

:::tip[Deep Child]

Deep child content

:::

## **Content Organization Patterns**

### **FAQ Sections**

Organize frequently asked questions using admonitions:

```jsx
## Frequently Asked Questions

:::question How do I update Docusaurus?
Run the following command to update to the latest version:

```bash
npm update @docusaurus/core @docusaurus/preset-classic
```

Check the [changelog](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes.
:::

:::question Can I use custom domains?
Yes! You can deploy Docusaurus to any hosting provider that supports static sites:

- **GitHub Pages**: Built-in support with GitHub Actions
- **Netlify**: Automatic deployments from Git
- **Vercel**: Zero-configuration deployments
- **Custom server**: Deploy the `build` folder anywhere

Configure your domain in the hosting provider's settings.
:::

:::question How do I add search functionality?
Docusaurus supports several search solutions:

1. **Algolia DocSearch** (recommended for open source)
2. **Local search** with `@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia`
3. **Custom search** integration

See the [search documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search) for setup instructions.
:::
```

### **Troubleshooting Guides**

Structure troubleshooting information clearly:

```jsx
## Troubleshooting

:::danger Build Failures
If your build is failing, try these solutions in order:

:::caution Check Node.js Version
Ensure you're using a supported Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
# Should be 16.x or higher
```
:::

:::caution Clear Cache
Clear npm/yarn cache and node_modules:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
:::

:::caution Check for Syntax Errors
Look for MDX syntax errors in your files:
- Unclosed JSX tags
- Missing imports for components
- Invalid frontmatter
:::
:::

:::warning Performance Issues
If your site is loading slowly:

1. **Optimize images**: Use WebP format when possible
2. **Bundle analysis**: Run `npm run build -- --bundle-analyzer`
3. **Lazy loading**: Use dynamic imports for heavy components
4. **CDN**: Consider using a Content Delivery Network

:::info Bundle Size Analysis
Install and run the bundle analyzer:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
npm run build -- --bundle-analyzer
```
:::
:::
```

## **Visual Enhancements**

### **Color-Coded Information**

Use different admonition types to create visual hierarchies:

```jsx
:::danger Critical Security Update
**Action Required**: Update immediately to patch security vulnerability CVE-2024-XXXX.

:::caution Before Updating
1. Backup your data
2. Test in staging environment
3. Schedule maintenance window
:::

:::info Update Commands
```bash
# For npm users
npm update package-name

# For yarn users
yarn upgrade package-name
```
:::

:::tip Post-Update Steps
After updating:
- Clear browser cache
- Restart your application
- Verify all functionality works
- Monitor logs for errors
:::
:::
```

### **Progressive Information Disclosure**

Layer information complexity using nested structures:

```jsx
:::info Docker Basics
Docker containers are lightweight, portable environments for running applications.

  :::note Key Concepts
  - **Image**: A template for creating containers
  - **Container**: A running instance of an image
  - **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building an image
  - **Registry**: A repository for storing images
  :::

  :::tip Getting Started
  Try running your first container:

  ```bash
  docker run hello-world
  ```

    :::caution Common Issues
    If you get permission errors, you may need to:
    1. Add your user to the docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
    2. Log out and log back in
    3. Or use `sudo` with docker commands

```

## **Best Practices**

### **Admonition Usage Guidelines**

- **Be consistent**: Use the same admonition types for similar content throughout your documentation
- **Don't overuse**: Too many admonitions can make content hard to scan
- **Hierarchy matters**: Use different types to create information hierarchy
- **Mobile friendly**: Test how admonitions look on mobile devices

### **Content Structure**

```jsx
<!-- Good: Clear purpose and appropriate type -->
:::tip Performance Optimization
Enable gzip compression on your web server to reduce file sizes by up to 70%.
:::

<!-- Avoid: Wrong type for content -->
:::danger
This section explains how to configure your database settings.
:::

<!-- Good: Nested structure for complex information -->
:::info Database Setup
Configure your database connection:

  :::caution Security
  Never commit database credentials to version control.
  :::

```yaml
database:
  host: ${DB_HOST}
  password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
```
:::
```

### **Accessibility Considerations**

- Use semantic markup within admonitions
- Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards
- Provide text alternatives for important visual information
- Test with screen readers
