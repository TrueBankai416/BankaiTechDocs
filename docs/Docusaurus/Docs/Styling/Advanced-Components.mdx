# **Advanced Components & Features**

Docusaurus provides many advanced components and features beyond basic markdown that can enhance your documentation's interactivity and visual appeal. This guide covers admonitions, callouts, custom components, and more advanced styling techniques.

## **Admonitions (Callouts)**

Admonitions are specially formatted blocks that highlight important information. They're perfect for notes, warnings, tips, and other contextual information.

### **Basic Admonitions**

Here are the five default admonition types:

```jsx
:::note
This is a note admonition. Use it for additional information that's helpful but not critical.
:::

:::tip
This is a tip admonition. Use it for helpful advice or best practices.
:::

:::info
This is an info admonition. Use it for neutral, informational content.
:::

:::caution
This is a caution admonition. Use it for warnings about potential issues.
:::

:::danger
This is a danger admonition. Use it for critical warnings about serious problems.
:::
```

**Results:**

:::note
This is a note admonition. Use it for additional information that's helpful but not critical.
:::

:::tip
This is a tip admonition. Use it for helpful advice or best practices.
:::

:::info
This is an info admonition. Use it for neutral, informational content.
:::

:::caution
This is a caution admonition. Use it for warnings about potential issues.
:::

:::danger
This is a danger admonition. Use it for critical warnings about serious problems.
:::

### **Custom Titles**

You can customize the title of any admonition:

```jsx
:::tip Pro Tip
Always backup your data before making major changes to your system.
:::

:::caution Breaking Change in v2.0
The API endpoint `/api/v1/users` has been deprecated. Use `/api/v2/users` instead.
:::

:::info Did You Know?
Docusaurus was originally created by Facebook (now Meta) for their own documentation needs.
:::
```

**Results:**

:::tip Pro Tip
Always backup your data before making major changes to your system.
:::

:::caution Breaking Change in v2.0
The API endpoint `/api/v1/users` has been deprecated. Use `/api/v2/users` instead.
:::

:::info Did You Know?
Docusaurus was originally created by Facebook (now Meta) for their own documentation needs.
:::

### **Nested Admonitions**

```
:::::info[Parent]

Parent content

::::danger[Child]

Child content

:::tip[Deep Child]

Deep child content

:::

::::

:::::
```

**Result:**

:::::info[Parent]

Parent content

::::danger[Child]

Child content

:::tip[Deep Child]

Deep child content

:::

::::

:::::

## **Best Practices**

### **Admonition Usage Guidelines**

- **Be consistent**: Use the same admonition types for similar content throughout your documentation
- **Don't overuse**: Too many admonitions can make content hard to scan
- **Hierarchy matters**: Use different types to create information hierarchy
- **Mobile friendly**: Test how admonitions look on mobile devices

### **Content Structure**

```jsx
<!-- Good: Clear purpose and appropriate type -->
:::tip Performance Optimization
Enable gzip compression on your web server to reduce file sizes by up to 70%.
:::

<!-- Avoid: Wrong type for content -->
:::danger
This section explains how to configure your database settings.
:::

<!-- Good: Nested structure for complex information -->
:::info Database Setup
Configure your database connection:

  :::caution Security
  Never commit database credentials to version control.
  :::

```yaml
database:
  host: ${DB_HOST}
  password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
```
:::
```

### **Accessibility Considerations**

- Use semantic markup within admonitions
- Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards
- Provide text alternatives for important visual information
- Test with screen readers
